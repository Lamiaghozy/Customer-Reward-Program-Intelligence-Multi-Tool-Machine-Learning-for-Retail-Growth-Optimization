🧠 Multi-Tool Machine Learning for Retail Reward Optimisation 
A KNIME, RapidMiner & Python Comparative Analytics Project

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end application of machine learning techniques across three leading analytics platforms — KNIME, RapidMiner, and Python (scikit-learn) — to predict and optimise customer reward programs for retail businesses.

It was designed to compare model performance across tools, strengthen cross-platform BI & ML expertise, and extract actionable insights relevant to real-world retail strategy.

🎯 Business Objective

Retailers often face the challenge of identifying which factors drive customer reward adoption and effectiveness.
This project explores:

Which business metrics best predict reward participation

How tree-based models and neural networks perform in classification and regression tasks

How bagging and boosting affect predictive performance

💡 Insights

Profit margin is the most influential factor in predicting reward program participation.

Ensemble methods (bagging/boosting) provide moderate improvement in stability but limited uplift on small datasets.

Neural networks show consistent RMSE performance, suggesting diminishing returns with a small sample size.

Demonstrates strong cross-platform mastery—a key advantage for data science roles requiring tool flexibility.
